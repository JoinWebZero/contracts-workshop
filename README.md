This workshop aims to introduce you to [ink!](https://use.ink/), the native smart contracting language for the [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/) ecosystem, by completing a series of hands-on quests.
Use this repository to refer to installation instructions and to submit your proof of quests.

## 🎒 Workshop quests

> 🔎 To submit your proof of quest, simply clone this repo and make a PR to the `submissions` folder titled `Quest submission: {your name,} {date}` containing a short summary of the quests you've completed. Include screenshots if relevant and a reviewer will verify your submission.

Your proof of quest PR should create a new folder in the `submissions` folder with your name or pseudonym and contain:
1. A screenshot of your terminal after running `cargo contract build`.
2. A screenshot of the Contracts UI showing the event you created being emitted.

Have a look at [this example](https://github.com/JoinWebZero/contracts-workshop/pull/1) for reference.

Your workshop facilitator will provide you with a feedback form where, once you provide some feebdack, you can provide a link to your submission PR to be eligible for quest rewards. 😎
